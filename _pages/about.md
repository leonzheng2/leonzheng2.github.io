I am a second-year PhD student at [valeo.ai](https://www.valeo.com/en/valeo-ai/) and ENS Lyon (LIP, [Inria DANTE](https://team.inria.fr/dante/fr/)), under the supervision of [Rémi Gribonval](https://people.irisa.fr/Remi.Gribonval/), [Patrick Pérez](https://ptrckprz.github.io/), [Gilles Puy](https://sites.google.com/site/puygilles/) and [Elisa Riccietti](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/elisa.riccietti/). My current research is focused on sparse matrix factorization, neural network compression with sparsity, and self-supervised learning for image representations.
I graduated from [École Polytechnique](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program) (X2016) and [Master M2 "Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage"](https://www.master-mva.com/) at ENS Paris-Saclay in 2020.

News:
* 2023/01: Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00789) on self-supervised learning with rotation-invariant kernels has been accepted at ICLR 2023 (notable-top-25%).
* 2022/11: I will present our [work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01230) on butterfly matrix factorization during the minisymposium "Butterfly factorizations: Algorithms, applications, and theory" at SIAM CSE'23.
