I am a third-year PhD student at [valeo.ai](https://valeoai.github.io/blog/) and [École normale supérieure de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/) ([LIP](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/), [Inria OKCHAM](https://team.inria.fr/ockham/)), under the supervision of [Rémi Gribonval](https://people.irisa.fr/Remi.Gribonval/), [Patrick Pérez](https://ptrckprz.github.io/), [Gilles Puy](https://sites.google.com/site/puygilles/) and [Elisa Riccietti](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/elisa.riccietti/). I graduated from [École Polytechnique](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program) (X2016) and [Master M2 "Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage"](https://www.master-mva.com/) at ENS Paris-Saclay in 2020.

My current research is focused on sparse matrix factorization, butterfly factorization, neural network compression with sparsity, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and self-supervised learning for image representations.

I am looking for a post-doc position in academia or a researcher position in industry starting from May 2024, feel free to contact me.
